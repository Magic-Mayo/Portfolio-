                            My name is Michael Mayo, II, but you can just call me Mike. I am currently employed in the
                            automotive industry as a technician but have set a goal to change careers by the end of the year.
                            I plan to do that by completing the University of Arizona's coding bootcamp and become a developer.
                            I am very excited to take on this journey and cannot wait to see what the end of it holds for me!<br>
                        </p>
                            
                        <p class="intro">
                            I'll start with a little history on myself and how I came to this point. I began my adult life
                            serving five years in the US Air Force as an Avionics System Technian on F-16 aircraft. I enjoyed
                            the time I spent in the Air Force but never intended it to be a full career. After separating from
                            the Air Force I went to school at Unviersal Technical Institute and earned an Associate's degree in
                            Automotive Technology. From there I went on to earn seven ASE certifications as well as become an
                            inspector for Virginia's annual state safety inspection, which is required for all vehicles registered in
                            the state of Virginia.<br>
                        </p>
                            
                        <p class="intro">
                            Since making the transition from the Air Force to the civilian world and working on cars I haven't been
                            challenged in ways I need to be. Day to day work has become very simple and repetitive and I need a career that will stimulate my mind and enjoy what I do. I have since found out about coding and the
                            development world and have been extremely intrigued by it! With the way technology changes and evolves so quickly I believe I will always have the challenge I need to enjoy work.<br>
                        </p>
                            
                        <p class="intro">
                            One of the accomplishments, professional or personal, I am most proud of is hiking the Southern
                            California section of the Pacific Crest Trail. If you've never heard of the Pacific Crest Trail, it runs from the California/Mexico border and winds through California, Oregon, and Washington and finishes eight miles
                            into Canada.  The full trail is over 2,600 miles long! I intended on completing the full length of the trail but was forced to come home due to injuries I could no longer hike on. I hiked through numerous injuries on the trail but ultimately I decided long-term health was more important than finishing something I could always come back to. Hiking 700 miles is still a feat in itself and I plan to go back someday and finish what I started!<br>
                        </p>
                            
                        <p class="intro">
                            With this new career in sight I believe I will have greater oppurtunity to do the things I love outside
                            of work and also make a career which I love. I foresee more flexibility and more oppurtunity for growth than what I have in my current occupation. I am determined to make the most of the new career and will not be looking back!

This was a challenge for me not only because I like to choose more difficult tasks to take on but also because there was a huge learning curve as I went into this knowing very little.  In the end I found it turned out better than I had initially hoped!</p>

The format of the page is very simple but it works very well.  As of now it is just set up to take in information and keep it on screen for anyone to see.  In the future, I would like to apply a user authentication which will allow each separate user to input their own schedule so only they can see it.  This can be a useful tool not only for keeping a train or public transit schedule but for really anything you want to schedule if the design is implemented in this way.</p>

We started this project with the thought of building something that would be useful for either people who travel or move a lot.  We ended up with a simple, yet very useful tool.  You can enter a location and get jobs, events, points of interest, and weather data back all in one search!  With a few minor adjustments, like user authentication and some more styling, I think this project could turn into more than just a project.</p>

If you would've asked me just a couple months ago to write a program with Node.js I would have asked you to explain to me what Node.js even is!  But here we are creating programs to interact with external APIs and return information we are asking for!  This program will retrieve movie, music, and concert information based on what the user wants.  It's a pretty simple yet versatile application!</p>
